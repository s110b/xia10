      <p>I recently started shooting lifestyle newborn photoshoots in a hospital. After this month, there would be month by month best photographs from the photoshoots in the hospital. 
I enjoy doing it, enjoy looking at happy parents and happy newborns, this is one of the best jobs one could ever have!</p>

      <p>I was approached by the lovely couple if I could do a photoshoot with them two together. It was also a make up trial for the future bride. The whole photoshoot was very interesting and enjoyable, especially considering that the weather was perfect and it was in one of the parks in Washington DC.</p>

      <p>I organize meetups for fellow photographers and models (or people who want to practice their modeling skills). Had a couple of great shots that day! Loved how people posed. Also, loved walking around Tidal Basin when it wasn’t as crowded during that day.</p>

      <p>I was contacted by a makeup artist asking if I want to take a photo of her work. I replied that, yes, I would love to. In the end, it was one of my favorite photoshoots. I loved every part of it. Also, I loved her work. Since I don’t normally do these kinds of photoshoots, this is called “an experiment”.</p>

      <p>I like experimenting and being creative. One of the things where you actually have to think about and to be very creative is still life photography. No matter what are you taking photographs of in still life, even in food photography, you have to be creative. That’s one of my experiments and I actually enjoyed it.</p>

      <p>A family won a photoshoot from me in one of my giveaways. It was a family photoshoot in one of the local parks in Washington, DC area (near Annapolis, Maryland). I tried to make as relaxing and as fun as possible. And they’ve enjoyed it!</p>

      <p>During one of the photoshoots, model and I, decided to take a walk around the city. Also, during our walk, we decided to go to one of the restaurants that had an outdoor terrace and drank tea together (only I was behind the camera).</p>

      <p>This was one of my first weddings. And I loved every part of it, almost cried myself when bride and groom were saying vows to each other and kissed each other.
There are only some of the photos because most people wanted to have privacy and didn’t want any photographs of themselves on the Internet.</p>

      <p>It was a semi-trial photoshoot that I offered to clients. This photoshoot was offered for them as a gift because they’ve booked a wedding photoshoot with them. We walked around the park and got to know each other. They were a really fun couple to be around and I enjoyed spending time with them!</p>

      <p>Not a lot of men like to have their photographs taken. His request was “do some unusual photoshoot with me.” It was a challenge, but a good one. I liked it, I hope that this person liked it as well.</p>
